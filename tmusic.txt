ABOUT US 
Tempest Music was established in 1979 by talented musician Frances Tempest. 
From humble beginnings as a specialist sheet music store, Tempest Music has grown exponentially, supplying anything a musician could ever need.
The staff at Tempest Music spend considerable time with each of their customers guiding them through the musical instrument selection process. 
This is based on the belief that it is essential to try different instruments and make a careful selection to complement each individual musician's experience level and budget. 
Because of this philosophy, Tempest Music has been approached by many leading instrument brands to stock their items in store. 
They do this knowing that the expert advice Tempest Music offers to each customer will best match the musician to the instrument, allowing them the best chance to succeed on their musical journey.
